🎉 **Credit Card Fraud Detection using Anomaly Detection: Safeguarding Your Finances!** 💳

Worried about fraudulent transactions on your credit card? 😱 This project dives deep into the world of anomaly detection to build a robust system that can identify and flag potentially fraudulent activities. 🛡️

**What's the project about?** 🤔

We've developed a system that uses machine learning to analyze credit card transactions and pinpoint those that deviate from normal spending patterns. Think of it as a digital detective for your finances! 🕵️‍♀️

**How does it work?** ⚙️

1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** We gathered a dataset of credit card transactions and cleaned it up, handling missing values and converting categorical data into a format our models could understand. 🧹

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering:** We carefully selected relevant features from the transaction data, like transaction amount, time, location, and merchant category, to help our models learn the patterns of normal and fraudulent behavior. 📊

3️⃣ **Anomaly Detection Algorithms:** We explored and compared several powerful anomaly detection algorithms:

   * **Isolation Forest:** 🌳 This algorithm isolates "anomalies" that are easier to separate from the rest of the data, like finding a needle in a haystack! 🔍
   * **Local Outlier Factor (LOF):** 🏘️ This method identifies data points that have a significantly lower density than their neighbors, suggesting they might be outliers.
   * **DBSCAN:** 🌀 This clustering algorithm groups similar data points together and identifies those that don't belong to any cluster as anomalies.
   * **Autoencoders:** 🤖 These neural networks learn to reconstruct normal transactions, and those that are poorly reconstructed are flagged as potentially fraudulent.
   * **One-Class SVM:** 🎯 This algorithm learns to define a boundary around normal transactions, and any transactions falling outside this boundary are considered anomalous.

4️⃣ **Model Evaluation:** We rigorously tested each algorithm using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score to determine which one performed best at identifying fraudulent transactions. 📈

**Key Findings:** 💡

Our experiments showed that One-Class SVM achieved the best balance between accuracy, recall, and overall model quality, making it the most effective choice for detecting fraud. 🥇 Isolation Forest also performed well, achieving a high ROC AUC score and recall.

**Conclusion:** 🏁

This project demonstrates the power of anomaly detection in building effective credit card fraud detection systems. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can identify suspicious transactions and protect individuals and financial institutions from financial losses. 💰
